Priya Okafor, Julian Boyd, Renata Marchetti, and Owen Callahan were still carrying `location: inside the Ashfield Gate` after the crew exited it on 2026-07-28 (`EVT-000080`) and spent 2026-07-29 in the city (`EVT-000083`) — stale presence surviving two promotions. Presence is owned by each entity's own `canonical_state.location` (Data Model Sections 7.1, 9.2; Decision 073), so it is corrected here. Only Owen's position is established precisely by canon; the other three are placed in Chicago without inventing a more specific position than the fiction has established."

## Campaign-Local Figures — Session 1

### ENT-000126 — Tanya Voss

Crew lead and striker; mid-30s, an experienced Gate clearer with three-plus clears behind her alongside Marcus. She recruited Alexander onto the Red Line Corridor contract after reading him as someone who would commit rather than fold — reputation is "what the desk thinks," she told him, and "fact is what happens in a Gate." Her signature ability is **Keen Edge**: her mana runs along any blade she grips, holding an edge that bites seams plain steel skids off.

canonical_state:
  location: ENT-000087
  condition: "Healthy; equipped with a heavier reinforced jacket and shoulder plating than an E-rank starter kit"
  capabilities: "Experienced licensed hunter and crew leader; striker working type; three-plus prior Gate clears with Marcus. Reads people quickly and decisively."
  signature_ability: "Keen Edge — her mana runs along any blade she grips, holding an edge that bites armor seams plain steel skids off (Profile Section 13.6: method texture, resolved at her band)."
  appearance: "Mid-30s, white, of Dutch-German stock (the Voss name); medium height with a wiry, hard-muscled fighter's build. Short dark-blonde hair pushed back off a sharp, weathered face; pale grey eyes that size a person up in a glance; a thin old scar along the left forearm. Wears a heavy charcoal reinforced jacket with steel shoulder plating over practical dark gear, a well-used single-edged blade at her hip. Reads as exactly what she is — a decade-hardened crew lead who wastes no motion."
  portrait: "assets/portraits/Tanya_Voss_ENT-000126.png"
  personality: "Direct, competent, unsentimental. Judges hunters by conduct in a Gate, not by desk reputation. Takes calculated risks on people who show commitment; does not waste time on those she expects to fold."
  situation: "Led the five-hunter Red Line Corridor clear (true grade E, one below the unconfirmed D assessment) to a full, no-casualty clear on 2026-07-24 (`EVT-000059`), then the loot phase and exit (`EVT-000060`): coached Alexander through mining the vein herself (chisel technique), signed off on his safe-target haul (five mined E-crystals), and closed the contract at the Coalition desk, filing the payout and crystal sale on 2026-07-25. Her regard for him ended the day at genuine respect, reinforced once more by his sincere, unshowy goodbye and his candor about being new to a hunter's income. Crew dispersed that evening; she told Alexander he's welcome back on the next posting whenever the crew looks at the boards again, expected in a few days, not tomorrow."
```

### ENT-000127 — Marcus Aldridge

The crew's sensor: an awakened whose gift reads Gate interiors — layout, population density, and whether a dungeon is holding something its assessment missed. Quiet and analytical; he is Tanya Voss's established partner and reads the space on entry so the crew knows what it is actually walking into.

  condition: "Healthy; no adverse condition established"
  capabilities: "Sensor working type: reads Gate interior layout, population density, and anomalies on entry. Tanya Voss's established clearing partner; better at field triage-by-read than at combat."
  signature_ability: "Deep Read — he perceives a Gate interior through the mana in its air: layout, population weight, age of a signature, and whether something is watching back (Profile Section 13.6)."
  appearance: "Early 30s, Black, medium height and lean; close-cropped hair and a short beard. A calm, heavy-lidded gaze that always seems to look slightly past you — the sensor's habit of reading a room rather than watching it. Dresses down in muted layers with minimal gear and no visible weapon; still and unhurried, hands loose at his sides. Quiet enough to be easy to overlook, which suits him."
  portrait: "assets/portraits/Marcus_Aldridge_ENT-000127.png"
  personality: "Quiet, focused, observes before acting. Takes the measure of new people carefully."
  situation: "Assigned to point for the Red Line Corridor clear, reading the interior on entry. Present at the 2026-07-23 briefing and at the Gate entrance on 2026-07-24. At the walk-out (`EVT-000059`) he noted, without knowing why, that something seemed to be sitting unresolved behind Alexander's eyes since the fight — an observation of visible distraction, not knowledge of the System, which remains unknown to him. Surname: Aldridge."
```

### ENT-000128 — Elias Voss

Striker and Tanya's brother; broad-shouldered, blunt-force fighter carrying a reinforced steel hammer, two-plus years licensed. He greeted Alexander warmly and told him plainly that if they were in the Gate together, he had his back.

  signature_ability: "Groundbreak — braced, he cannot be knocked from his feet, and his hammer-blows carry a ground-shock through whatever his stance is planted on (Profile Section 13.6)."
  appearance: "Late 30s, white, unmistakably Tanya's brother — the same sharp features on a much bigger frame: broad-shouldered, thick through the chest and arms, a head taller than his sister. Short dark-blonde hair and a trimmed beard, an easy warm grin that reaches his eyes. Reinforced plated jacket strained across the shoulders; a heavy reinforced steel warhammer carried like it weighs nothing. Looks like the wall you want between you and a beast, and knows it."
  portrait: "assets/portraits/Elias_Voss_ENT-000128.png"
  personality: "Confident, warm, reassuring. Supportive of newer hunters."
  situation: "Crew member for the Red Line Corridor clear and Tanya Voss's brother. Introduced himself to Alexander at the Gate entrance on 2026-07-24 and assured him of support inside."
```

### ENT-000129 — Dr. Sarah Chen

The crew's mender — the rare awakened who heals by touch, closing wounds mid-fight (roughly one awakened in twelve). Six months licensed; Horizon Guild tried to poach her twice and she stayed independent. Petite, athletic, medical kit across her chest; calm and crisis-trained. She told Alexander plainly: stay alive, and let her keep him that way.

Six months licensed; twice declined Horizon Guild recruitment to stay independent. Trained for crisis triage. Field-touch magnitudes per Profile Section 13.5."
  signature_ability: "Mending Touch — her mana closes what it is laid against: flesh knits under her hands, the classic mender manifestation (Profile Section 13.6; magnitudes per Section 13.5)."
  appearance: "Late 20s, East Asian (Chinese-American), petite and compactly athletic. Straight black hair kept in a practical short cut or tied back off her face; steady dark eyes; an economical, unfussy way of moving. A padded field-medical harness and kit ride across her chest over clean, close-fitting practical clothing. Calm to the point of stillness under pressure — the composure of someone who has held a stranger together with her hands."
  portrait: "assets/portraits/Sarah_Chen_ENT-000129.png"
  personality: "Calm, focused, prioritizes keeping people alive. Direct about her role and what she expects of the crew."
  situation: "Mender for the Red Line Corridor clear. Spent two of her three per-clear field-touches on Alexander after he took serious wounds from a common beast and, later, the boss's opening leap — both times bringing him back from a dangerous margin. One field-touch remains banked for the walk out. Currently treating the crew's wounds in the post-boss window before they exit."
```

### ENT-000130 — Kesha Morrison

Senior coordinator at the Windy City Hunters Coalition desk; about fifty, solid build, a memory for faces and files that makes her good at the job. She had spent days looking at Alexander's file with visible doubt — but when he came back with a signed contract, she witnessed it, filed it with Region V, and allowed that he had made a good pull.

  condition: "Healthy; no adverse condition established"
  capabilities: "Senior freelancer coordinator at the Windy City Hunters Coalition; manages postings, crew assignments, and contract witnessing/filing with BGM Region V. Strong memory for hunters' files and faces. Not established as a combat-active hunter."
  appearance: "About fifty, Black, sturdy and solid — the settled build of a woman who runs a desk, not a Gate. Natural hair going handsomely grey, worn short or in neat twists; reading glasses on a beaded chain; a sharp, tired, kindly gaze that has read ten thousand files. Business-casual — a good blazer over something practical — behind a cluttered coordinator's counter. Warm without being soft, and forgets nothing."
  portrait: "assets/portraits/Kesha_Morrison_ENT-000130.png"
  personality: "Direct and professional. Reads a file and communicates doubt without cruelty; respects hunters who follow through on a commitment."
  situation: "Alexander's principal Coalition desk contact. On 2026-07-23 she pointed him toward Tanya Voss's undersubscribed Red Line crew, witnessed and filed his signed contract, and gave him a list of three E-grade gear vendors. On 2026-07-25 (`EVT-000060`) she filed the Red Line Corridor contract's payout and crystal-sale paperwork (quoting 1–2 business days to clear) and walked Alexander through the current board: two E-D waiver-tier crews short a fifth, a standing ask for harvest-element hires (having heard through the crew grapevine that he'd done real mining work, not just stood around), a live confirmed-D rail-yard contract with one open harvest slot filed for 2026-07-26 07:00 (`EVT-000061`). She initially told him C-grade work was closed to him outright — corrected per `EVT-000062`: his E-card bars him only from **strike/combat** contracts at C-grade and above (Profile Section 19.4); harvest/support work is not rank-gated at all (Section 9.4, `d53114b`), so a C- or even B-Gate's mining crew is legally open to him right now, card notwithstanding.\n\n  Later that same day (`EVT-000063`), Alexander returned; she actually checked the board this time and surfaced a confirmed C-grade harvest slot at the Cicero Scar with the same corporate-adjacent contractor, staging that afternoon — he took it, and she filed him onto it. He came back a third time after the Cicero Scar job to ask about a further C-grade slot for 2026-07-26; she found one (Frozen Gallery archetype, same contractor, logistics run by Dale — `ENT-000135`) and pulled him off the never-confirmed D-grade rail-yard interest to put him on it instead. She also confirmed for him that Coalition freelancer registration carries no base salary — income comes only from work actually taken."
```

### ENT-000131 — Diane Halloran

Owner and operator of **Ironbound**, the independent gear shop on Milwaukee Avenue; mid-40s, built solid, moving with the bearing of someone who has spent time in Gates. She fitted Alexander for his first kit, steered him toward mobility over heavy plate given his krav maga background, and told him to come back after his first clear to talk over what worked. (Ironbound the establishment is represented at this stage by its owner Diane; it carries no separate institution entity.)

  appearance: "Mid-40s, white, solidly muscular with the bearing of a former hunter who never lost the frame. Short practical greying hair, calloused scarred hands, an old burn or two up one forearm; a level, appraising look that measures you the way she measures a fitting. A worn leather shop-apron over a henley, tape measure and tools to hand, at home amid racks of gear. Plainspoken and unhurried."
  portrait: "assets/portraits/Diane_Halloran_ENT-000131.png"
  personality: "Professional, practical, plainspoken. Values mobility and function over decoration; takes fitting seriously."
  situation: "Sold Alexander his first hunter-grade kit on 2026-07-23 (reinforced leather jacket $800, E-grade dagger $500, reinforced gauntlets $600, shin guards $100; $2,000 total), custom-fitted the gauntlets, and invited him back after his first clear. Represents the Ironbound establishment, which has no separate entity."
```

### ENT-000132 — Cutting Edge

A custom E-/D-grade gear shop in Chicago's warehouse district, one of three vendors Kesha Morrison named to Alexander. Known for good-quality custom work on a slower turnaround. Alexander did not visit it.

```

### ENT-000133 — Horizon's Outfitter

Horizon Guild's affiliated gear outfitter on Michigan Avenue, the third vendor on Kesha Morrison's list: pricier than the independents, but reliable stock and service with no custom-fitting delay. Alexander chose Ironbound over it for value and did not visit.

Not visited; interior, staff, and exact pricing unestablished. No standing relationship between Alexander and Horizon established by this mention."
```

### ENT-000140 — Vanguard Trade & Gear

A larger licensed hunter outfitter than Ironbound — a proper storefront with counter staff rather than a single owner-operator, on a commercial strip Alexander's 2026-07-29 running route happened to pass. Visited once, for a replacement resonance chisel.

  function: "Licensed retailer of civilian-tier E-grade hunter gear — the same mundane tier Ironbound carries, not graded combat equipment (C-grade and above is guild-armory or System-shop territory only, per Section 11.5). Distinguished from Ironbound by selection and foot traffic rather than by stock tier: several resonance chisel models, a fuller mundane first-aid and field-kit wall, and a storefront big enough that no one clocks a hunter in running clothes."
  standing: "Independent of Ironbound and unaffiliated with either major guild. First visited by Alexander 2026-07-29 for a replacement resonance chisel; bought both a standard chisel ($75) and a heavier 'Longhaul' model ($140), plus considered but declined a field trauma kit and a civilian duffel."
```

### ENT-000134 — Ada Reyes

Logistics coordinator for a corporate-adjacent contractor running harvest-hire C-grade Gate clears; broad-shouldered, carries a foreman's vest and a tablet, not a combatant. Ran the Cicero Scar operation on 2026-07-25 — Alexander's first job under this contractor.

  appearance: "Forties, Latina, broad-shouldered and sturdy — built for long shifts on a staging line, not for the fight. Dark hair pulled back tight under a hi-vis foreman's vest worn over practical clothing; a rugged tablet always in one hand. Brisk, direct, and fair, with the unhurried authority of someone who has run a hundred crews through a hundred cordons and logged every one."
  portrait: "assets/portraits/Ada_Reyes_ENT-000134.png"
  personality: "Direct, professional, no patience for wasted time but fair — briefed Alexander plainly and complimented his declared haul (7 C-crystals) as better than a typical first-timer's."
  situation: "Ran the Cicero Scar C-grade harvest-element job on 2026-07-25 (`EVT-000063`): briefed Alexander, logged his 7 declared C-crystals, and gave him an off-the-cuff (and, on reconsideration, too low) verbal payout estimate of $1,500–2,500 before heading back to her own paperwork. Vouched for him afterward to the contractor's other logistics staff, which is how Dale (`ENT-000135`) already knew his name at the next job."
```

### ENT-000135 — Dale Pruitt

Logistics coordinator for the same corporate-adjacent contractor, running a separate C-grade harvest-hire operation. Stocky, tablet-carrying, same role as Ada Reyes on a different site.

An easy, dryly amused half-smile is his resting face — the kind that can flatten into watchfulness the instant a number doesn't add up, then relax again just as fast."
  portrait: "assets/portraits/Dale_Pruitt_ENT-000135.png"
  personality: "Easygoing, dryly amused — greeted Alexander's explanation for arriving sweaty (a run doubling as commute) with open approval rather than suspicion."
  situation: "Ran the 2026-07-26 C-grade harvest-element job (confirmed grade, archetype Frozen Gallery) that Alexander signed onto through Kesha Morrison, now complete (`EVT-000065`–`EVT-000068`). Already knew his name and reputation as a reliable cutter from Ada Reyes's word passed through the contractor. Assigned Alexander three vein sections across the job, pulled him off the third for a genuine (if unnecessary) mandatory break after misreading a performed exhaustion, and directly challenged him once over a suspiciously long stillness (the 50-crystal sale) — deflected, but it left Dale visibly more watchful for the rest of the job, catching a second, shorter hitch near the end without escalating it. At declaration, logged Alexander's 41 C-crystals — the day's highest total by a wide margin — without further scrutiny, praised his work across both jobs, confirmed the contractor occasionally posts B-grade harvest work when available, and told Alexander he'd be near the top of the list for one. Parted on genuinely warm terms. Unaware of any of the six private System-shop sales Alexander made across the job, or of the tactical study Alexander made of the strike line during his break."
```

### ENT-000136 — Priya Okafor

Striker and crew lead running her own undersubscribed five-hunter crew. Not related to BGM Region V's director Naomi Okafor (`ENT-000107`) as far as anyone at the Coalition desk has established. Met Alexander in person for the first time 2026-07-28 at staging.

Alexander's potion restored her Health enough to fight properly but left the wound's severity untouched (Profile Section 6.4). She had the side properly assessed at a clinic on the morning of 2026-07-29 (`EVT-000081`), was visibly slow but present through that evening's Coalition meeting, and left the crew dinner early to ice it (`EVT-000083`). Never treated by Owen, who spent his one used touch on Alexander instead. On the morning of 2026-07-30 she is filing the Ashfield report and carrying the crew's crystals and cores in to close the contract; her exact position that morning is not established beyond Chicago."
  capabilities: "Striker; **D-rank**, made D roughly eight months ago — stated directly to Alexander (`EVT-000077`), the only above-E rank among the crew's combat element. Leads her own five-hunter crew. Solid, workmanlike reputation, nothing flashy — confirmed accurate by direct observation: competent, decisive, but not infallible. Approved Alexander's gear before entry and set his position (rear, paired with Owen, support role) based on Kesha's word about his read and his own self-description."
  appearance: "Late 30s, South Asian (the Priya name), solid and workmanlike — an athletic striker's build with nothing showy about it. Black hair in a tight, no-nonsense braid or bun; steady, level dark eyes; the small scars and worn gear of eight years in the trade. Practical reinforced combat kit, sensibly armored and sensibly maintained. Grounded and direct, quicker to own a mistake than to explain it away."
  portrait: "assets/portraits/Priya_Okafor_ENT-000136.png"
  personality: "Direct, practical, reads people's stated capabilities and works with them rather than around them. Took Alexander's honest self-assessment (support-leaning, analytical, dagger-and-krav-maga close combat) at face value and built the formation around it without argument. Owns a mistake plainly rather than deflecting it, and updates her read of someone fast when the evidence changes."
  background: "Boxed semi-competitively in her twenties before a knee injury and the awakening test landed the same year — 'God's way of telling me to hit things that hit back less predictably,' by her own account (`EVT-000083`). Has a partner at home, mentioned only briefly, and a garden she's disproportionately proud of, tomatoes specifically; genuinely bristles at any suggestion store-bought tomatoes are comparable."
  situation: "Led the crew into the Ashfield Gate on 2026-07-28. Personally engaged the first wave of common beasts cleanly. When the elite closed, attempted to intercept it on Alexander's called pattern-read (shoulder-drop lunge every third stride) and fumbled the timing badly — thrown hard into the ash, momentarily down while the elite broke past her toward the rear. Recovering, wounded, back in the fight, and watched Alexander finish the elite himself (`EVT-000076`) with visible recalculation of what he's actually worth.\n\nIn the aftermath (`EVT-000077`), took formal responsibility for the rear-pair formation gap when Alexander pointedly asked why no one came for him during his earlier near-death against the common beast — she hadn't seen it happen (mid-fight with the elite herself) and said so plainly, but owned the structural gap rather than deflecting to circumstance, and asked to be told in the future rather than finding out after. Confirmed crew ranks directly when asked: herself D-rank, Julian and Renata both E-rank, Owen C-rank.\n\n**The boss fight and after (`EVT-000079`, `EVT-000080`).** Ceded the tactical call to Alexander outright — 'you've earned the call twice today' — while demanding a real plan, and raised the honest objection that her wound made her unreliable on the front line. Accepted Alexander's potion with visible surprise at his having carried it, and noted aloud that he had been carrying it the whole time without pressing further. Fought the boss properly throughout, striking on the rotation as designed and exploiting its overshoot. Sat down in the ash afterward and laughed and cried at once, unembarrassed and unremarked by her crew.\n\n**On reporting:** she raised the filing problem herself and drew the line cleanly — she refused falsification outright, since her signature goes on the assessment line, but accepted Alexander's proposal of *delay*. She proposed the third road she intends to take: file it **true**, as an accurate account of a Gate the board mis-posted, which makes it BGM's failure rather than the crew's. She will not sit on it beyond the agreed **2026-07-29 18:00** reconvene. Her regard for Alexander is now considerable and openly stated, though she has also seen him overrule a crewmate coldly and advise against prompt reporting.\n\n**The filing, agreed (`EVT-000081`, 2026-07-29).** Kesha Morrison called her: Region V's monitoring registered the Gate's closure and the Coalition has been asked when the clear report is coming — routine, not accusatory. Priya set the meeting for that evening and invited Alexander's thoughts beforehand rather than in front of the crew, and spent the morning at a clinic having her side properly assessed. On his call she **accepted the 'no hero' emphasis**, disclosing that she had spent two hours drafting honest sentences that all made her sound like a passenger on her own clear, recognized that objection as vanity, and had intended to file it anyway. Her limits are exact and stated: she will **not** write that Alexander was absent or did not fight, and she will answer any direct question from Region V honestly — if asked point-blank who killed the boss she will say all of us and believe it, but she will not lie, because she is bad at it and it would hurt him worse when it broke. She required that Julian and Renata hear the same thing in the same room from Alexander, so nobody holds a secret they did not agree to. She observed from eight years in the trade that attention from Region V is 'not a promotion, it's a process.'"

### ENT-000137 — Julian Boyd

Striker on Priya Okafor's crew; broad-shouldered, economical with words, carries a **graded shotgun** (not a mundane firearm — confirmed by its effectiveness against monsters, `GTF-OVR-003`). Runs point when ranged work is called for.

  capabilities: "Striker, ranged specialist; **E-rank**, confirmed directly by Priya (`EVT-000077`). Carries a graded (mana-bearing) shotgun — confirmed effective against monsters, which a mundane firearm would not be (`GTF-OVR-003`). Quiet, economical, does a lazy half-salute rather than talk. Landed two clean kills on the first wave of common beasts."
  appearance: "Mid-30s, broad-shouldered and rangy, sun-weathered from seasons of outdoor harvest work before the shotgun. Short brown hair, perpetual stubble, a flat unbothered expression. Practical field gear with an old harvester's wear to it, and a distinctive graded (mana-etched) shotgun on a sling that never leaves his reach. Economical in everything — a man who says the necessary words and no others."
  portrait: "assets/portraits/Julian_Boyd_ENT-000137.png"
  personality: "Terse, unbothered, competent. Doesn't say much outside of what the fight needs — but loosens up considerably over food with people he trusts, disclosed 2026-07-29 (`EVT-000083`)."
  background: "Grew up on a family farm outside Peoria, downstate Illinois; parents still work the land, a brother he calls maybe monthly. Was already handling a shotgun clearing coyotes and worse off the property before he ever awakened — when the grading test flagged him, picking up a graded version of the same gun was the obvious move, not a new skill learned for the job. No family in Chicago. Off-hours he's slowly rebuilding a truck that by his own account shouldn't still run, and it's the one subject that gets him talking at length unprompted (`EVT-000083`)."
  situation: "Held the front line's choke point on entry alongside Priya and Renata, killing two common beasts outright. Present for the elite's breakthrough; did not engage it directly, and confirmed to Priya that he hadn't seen Alexander's near-death moment against the earlier common beast either — a short, humorless nod, no elaboration (`EVT-000077`).\n\n**The boss fight (`EVT-000079`, `EVT-000080`).** Held fire until Alexander's signal, then sustained an unbroken firing line on the boss for the entire engagement, and on command laid suppressing fire between the boss and Owen to deny that ground rather than to kill — the shot that turned the boss onto its dead limb and opened the killing sequence. Disclosed unprompted that he worked **two seasons on harvest crews** before taking up the shotgun: slow but careful, and he does not shatter crystal. Offered the boss-drop Longshot [C] directly to Priya as the better shot, unasked and without any claim on it; when Alexander coldly overruled him — split or buy-out — he accepted it flatly and without argument, and was already moving. Surname: Boyd."

### ENT-000138 — Renata Marchetti

Sensor/reader on Priya Okafor's crew; reads a room and its threats before anyone else does, by trained instinct rather than any established signature ability. Crouches over her gear with quick, practiced hands.

  capabilities: "Reads incoming threats and the shape of a fight early and accurately — an experienced hunter's trained instinct, not an established awakened signature ability. **E-rank**, confirmed directly by Priya (`EVT-000077`). Correctly identified the population as heavier than a D on first entry, and called the elite's approach and the den structure behind it before either was visually confirmed."
  appearance: "Thirties, lean and alert, with quick precise hands and a reader's habitual stillness. Dark hair tied back out of the way; watchful dark eyes that catch a wrong detail before anyone else does; minimal, well-kept field gear and no showy weapon. Says little, and what she says tends to be right — a presence people learn to listen to."
  portrait: "assets/portraits/Renata_Marchetti_ENT-000138.png"
  personality: "Quiet, observant, direct when it matters. Gave Alexander a quick, assessing nod on meeting him rather than small talk."
  background: "Six years as a Chicago beat cop before awakening — the source of the reading habit and the exit-scanning, not an awakened signature ability; her gift, disclosed 2026-07-29, is trained instinct alone (`EVT-000083`). Says the job burned her out well before Gates existed and that hunting is, unfairly, less bureaucratic than policing was. One younger sister; otherwise private about family, and shuts down further prying without unkindness. Plays competitive chess online, badly by her own account."
  situation: "Held the choke point alongside Priya and Julian on the first wave, deflecting one beast clear of a kill shot for someone else to finish. Correctly warned the crew of the elite's approach and its 'den structure' origin before it closed. Owen described her as someone 'you'll want to listen to when she says something's wrong.' After the elite's death, laid out the crew's live options to Alexander — push toward the unlocated den, fall back, or split to sweep the remaining pack — and deferred the call to Priya (`EVT-000077`).\n\n**The boss fight and after (`EVT-000079`, `EVT-000080`).** Objected correctly that reading and covering Owen were incompatible jobs, and was freed to read exclusively in the revised plan — after which her contribution was decisive. She guided the crew's unseen approach to the den, counted the population discrepancy nobody else had tracked (five of twelve commons killed, seven unaccounted), called the boss's every commitment during the fight, and after the kill produced a **complete, definitive read** of the interior: seven common beasts alive at the north wall, agitated, contained. She stated the containment rule plainly — nothing leaves a standing Gate — which converted an apparent crisis into a fight the crew could simply decline.\n\nOn the reporting question she supplied the decisive practical objection: **the loot declares the grade.** No appraiser logs C-grade crystals and cores against an E–D clear without asking, so the crew can lie on the form or sell the material, but not both. Her judgment was correct or decisive at every point of this clear, and everyone in the crew now visibly treats it that way."

### ENT-000139 — Owen Callahan

Mender on Priya Okafor's crew; lean, unhurried, chronically late, medical kit slung across his back. Has now twice directly observed Alexander's C-grade dagger appear in his hand with no draw and said nothing about it either time.

  location: "Owen Callahan's apartment, Rogers Park, Chicago (ENT-000087)"
  condition: "Healthy; took no injury in the Ashfield clear. His one spent per-clear touch — used to clear Alexander's Severe rib injury mid-boss-fight (`EVT-000080`) — belonged to that clear and does not carry forward. At his own apartment on the morning of 2026-07-30, asleep with an arm over Alexander, the two of them having spent their first night together (`EVT-000083`, `REL-000066`)."
  capabilities: "Mender working type; **C-rank** — confirmed directly by Priya (`EVT-000077`), the reason a waiver-tier crew could field a real mender at all, worth the cost to the rest of the split. Practical healing capacity, stated in his own words: roughly four to five people at ordinary injury severity per clear, or as few as two if treating something as severe as Alexander's earlier near-lethal hit — no hard cutoff, just diminishing effect the more he's pushed. Has not yet had to actually treat anyone this clear, despite Alexander taking a near-lethal hit — the daily-quest grant's full restore beat him to it."
  appearance: "Twenty-seven, white, handsome and unaware of it. Tall (182cm) and lean, but with a faint softness to him — the build of a man whose gift meant he never had to become a fighter. Light brown hair worn a little long and never quite deliberate; green eyes; two or three days of unstyled stubble that reads less as a look than as the residue of a chronically late man. His clothes are genuinely nice — good fabric, well chosen — and always worn slightly undone: a collar open a button too far, sleeves shoved up, something untucked, as though he dressed well and then ran for the door. The field-medical kit is slung across his back and rides there like part of him. Warm, unhurried, and faintly rumpled — a handsome man who'd be more comfortable if you didn't mention it."
  portrait: "assets/portraits/Owen_Callahan_ENT-000139.png"
  personality: "Easy, dryly funny, unshaken by danger ('long as nobody's bleeding yet, we're fine'). Watchful in a low-key way — noticed the C-grade dagger appear in Alexander's hand from nothing, twice, and said nothing concrete about it either time beyond a brief look. Genuinely startled by, and warm toward, a friendly gesture from someone he'd read as too intense for that."
  situation: "Positioned at the rear alongside Alexander per Priya's formation. Watched Alexander intercept a beast to protect him, watched him apparently die and then not (HP 0→40 via a claimed grant, though Owen has no way to know the mechanism — he only saw an impossible recovery), and watched the C-grade dagger materialize in Alexander's off-hand a second time during the elite's charge.\n\nIn the aftermath (`EVT-000077`), was the first to respond when Alexander raised the near-death moment directly — admitted he'd had the kit half open and simply wasn't fast enough to matter, and apologized, genuinely rather than performatively. Agreed to hold his healing in reserve at Alexander's own request. Accepted an arm around the shoulder and a joke about an owed beer with visible surprise — the first smile he's seen from Alexander all clear — and used the moment to put the dagger question on the record without pressing it: he still has no explanation for it and says he intends to keep not asking, but wanted that stated plainly rather than left unspoken.\n\n**The boss fight (`EVT-000079`, `EVT-000080`).** Agreed first and without hedging when Alexander proposed finishing the Gate, citing both Alexander's demonstrated competence and the beer he was owed. Objected honestly that standing alone in the open beside a C-grade boss fight made him the likely failure point, and asked that everyone know it going in rather than after. Ran toward Alexander twice under fire, the second time against Alexander's own explicit instruction not to. Watched a fourth unexplained thing — a healing potion produced from nowhere and handed to Priya — and said nothing. Arrived at a man he had watched take a killing blow to find him whole and untouched, and closed his kit without a word.\n\n**Cleared Alexander's Severe rib injury** (`EVT-000080`) — a resolved C-rank treatment touch under the newly authored Profile 1.5 Section 6.3, the first exercise of this world's mender rule and the moment his rank mattered concretely. He felt the broken bone under his hands in a body that read as physically untouched, and has stated he cannot reconcile those two facts.\n\n**On the report:** noted plainly and without self-congratulation that as the only correctly-ranked member of the crew he carries none of the legal risk, that he dislikes that, and that he wanted it said aloud rather than have anyone assume he was quietly comfortable with it.\n\n**The bar (`EVT-000080`).** Over the beer he'd claimed, Owen laid out unprompted and without accusation everything he has witnessed — the killing hit walked off with no mender's touch, the knife appearing from nothing twice, the potion produced from nowhere, and the broken ribs he could feel were real in a body that read as unharmed. He stated he is **not confused**, will not later construct a normal explanation and feel foolish, knows there isn't one, intends to keep his promise not to ask, and has spent one day watching what carrying it alone costs Alexander. He left the door open and did not push it. This is the furthest any NPC has come toward Alexander's secret (Profile Section 19) — still unreported and uninvestigated, but explicitly and mutually acknowledged. Alexander gave him a partial answer that same afternoon (`EVT-000081`): that something had happened to him and he does not understand it either. Owen refused to press, offered a permanent exit from the topic, pointed out that **nobody knows what awakening is** — including him, about his own gift — and then **released Alexander from the promise to explain**, substituting 'when you want to, if you want to.'\n\n**Personal relationship (`REL-000066`), from 2026-07-28 evening.** Drank with Alexander in place of being thanked, fell asleep in the booth, was taken home to Alexander's apartment rather than left, and the relationship became explicitly personal and physical the following morning. Disclosed ordinary biography — Rogers Park, awakened at twenty-two and cried about it, twice declined Horizon Guild contracts because 'guilds put you where the money is, not where the people are.'\n\n**On the filing:** authored the 'no hero' strategy the crew will use — the crew killed the boss in a long coordinated fight, Alexander was the support striker who got hurt and treated, a lie of emphasis rather than fact. When Alexander privately proposed that *Owen* take credit for the boss kill, he said he would sign it if asked and then argued it down: a mender with zero combat commendations killing a C-grade boss is more interesting than a striker doing it, it would open a file on him instead, and it needs four people to hold one lie under questioning. He insisted Alexander put the plan to Priya plainly rather than cleverly, since it is her signature. Due at the Coalition by 17:50 on 2026-07-29."

## Campaign Relationships

### REL-000062 — Windy City Hunters Coalition (institutional affiliation)

Defined in `110_WORLD_LEDGER.md` (`REC-000075`). Alexander's freelancer registration with the Coalition; as of 2026-07-23 it is the channel through which he was placed on Tanya Voss's crew.

qualities: "Alexander's place in Tanya Voss's five-hunter Red Line Corridor crew, anchored to the crew lead (Voss). Full roster: Tanya Voss (ENT-000126, lead/striker), Marcus (ENT-000127, sensor), Elias Voss (ENT-000128, striker), Dr. Sarah Chen (ENT-000129, mender), and Alexander Pendragon (ENT-000125, striker/martial artist). Contract: the posted Red Line Corridor clear (EVT-000051), unconfirmed D, timer breaking midnight 2026-07-24. Split: the Gatefall standard party split (Profile Section 13) — the crew leader takes a 10% leader's share off the top, and the remaining 90% is divided equally among all five members, leader included. Tanya's desk shorthand of a 'five-way split' referred to that equal division of the remainder; no flat-equal deviation was negotiated, so standard terms govern."
state: "Contract closed 2026-07-24 (`EVT-000060`): full clear, loot declared at exit, standard split applied ($10,000 contract + ≈$2,850 crystal/core value, Alexander's equal-fifth ≈$2,313), filed with Kesha Morrison at the Coalition on 2026-07-25 and pending payment (1–2 business days). The crew dispersed the evening of the clear; Tanya told Alexander he's welcome on the next posting whenever the crew looks at the boards again, expected in a few days. Her regard for him remains genuine respect, reinforced by his sincere goodbye and candor about being new to hunter income."
history: "Formed at the Coalition case table on 2026-07-23 when Alexander, directed by Kesha Morrison, committed to Voss's undersubscribed crew and signed the standard five-hunter contract (EVT-000058). Proved out on 2026-07-24 in the crew's first Gate together, the Red Line Corridor clear (EVT-000059)."

type: harvest-hire
qualities: "Alexander's standing as a harvest-element hire (miner) for a corporate-adjacent contractor running C-grade Gate clears, routed through the Windy City Hunters Coalition rather than a direct guild posting. Not a peer-crew membership like `REL-000063` — hired support labor, paid a harvest share off declared mined crystals rather than an equal split, per Profile Section 9.4/11.1 (exact split formula not yet authored in the world rules; this campaign's payout is by Runtime ruling)."
state: "Two jobs completed: the Cicero Scar C-grade clear (2026-07-25, `EVT-000063`) — 7 declared C-crystals, ≈$5,700 harvest share pending — and the Frozen Gallery C-grade clear (2026-07-26, complete, `EVT-000065`–`EVT-000068`), staffed by a different site coordinator (Dale, `ENT-000135`) who already knew Alexander by reputation from Ada Reyes. Three vein assignments worked at the Frozen Gallery, the third to genuine exhaustion: **41 C-crystals formally declared**, the highest single total of the crew, yielding a computed harvest-share payout of ≈$24,663 (Section 13.2, `EVT-000068`) — his largest to date. Six separate private sales (98 crystals, four of 12 and two of 50) were sold through the System shop across the job and never entered this contract's declared pool — undeclared theft under the standard support-contract terms, unknown to Dale or the contractor despite two close calls, both deflected. Dale confirmed the contractor occasionally posts B-grade harvest work and named Alexander a strong future candidate. No standing contract beyond a per-job basis; each job is taken individually through Kesha Morrison at the Coalition desk."
history: "Formed 2026-07-25 when Kesha Morrison surfaced the Cicero Scar harvest slot after Alexander asked specifically about C-grade mining work, following the correction that his E-card does not bar harvest work at any grade (`EVT-000062`)."

Full roster: Priya Okafor (`ENT-000136`, lead/striker), Julian (`ENT-000137`, ranged striker), Renata (`ENT-000138`, sensor), Owen (`ENT-000139`, mender), Alexander Pendragon (`ENT-000125`, support striker, rear position paired with Owen)."
state: "**Contract complete — the Gate is cleared, and the crew is out.** Confirmed 2026-07-28 at staging; formation set (Priya front; Julian/Renata mid; Owen/Alexander rear); the crew entered together and walked out four hours eleven minutes later having cleared a Gate a full grade above its posting. Alexander killed the fifth common beast solo, then the elite across four exchanges (`EVT-000076`), then — after Owen cleared the Severe injury the boss inflicted on him — the **boss itself** (`EVT-000080`), taking him from Level 3 to Level 7 across the clear. Seven common beasts were left alive and contained by the standing barrier, declined by crew decision, and went down with the instance.\n\nThe crew functioned as a genuine unit under Alexander's tactical direction from the elite onward: Priya ceded the call outright, Renata's reads were decisive at every point, Julian executed fire discipline exactly as ordered, and Owen held his healing in reserve on Alexander's own instruction and then spent a touch on him anyway. Alexander's rapport with Owen deepened markedly and specifically; his relations with the rest are respectful but cooler, and he overruled Julian coldly over the boss drop.\n\n**Resolved 2026-07-29 evening at the Coalition case table (`EVT-000083`).** Alexander delivered the agreed "no hero" account directly to Julian and Renata; both accepted it as consistent with what they'd personally lived through. The crystal/core pool (16 C-crystals, 2 C-cores, $52,500 declared value) split under standard terms — Priya's 10% plus an equal fifth, the rest split evenly five ways ($9,450 each, $14,700 to Priya). The Longshot [C] will be sold and its proceeds split the same way once appraised; no one on the crew uses a bow. Priya carries the physical crystals/cores to file the account and close the contract the morning of 2026-07-30.\n\n**By explicit ruling, tactical and strategic command in the field passes to Alexander going forward.** Priya proposed it herself, citing the precedent she'd already set inside the Ashfield Gate by ceding him the call outright during the boss fight. She keeps the contractual lead, her signature on every filing, and the 10% leader's share — the split above still reflects that. Julian and Renata both endorsed the arrangement without reservation."
history: "Formed 2026-07-27 when Kesha Morrison, following up on her promised morning callback (`EVT-000069`), reported two open E-D waiver-tier crew slots; Alexander asked after Okafor's posting specifically and committed to it over the phone.

He has also **twice declined to ask** — once unprompted, and once by explicitly releasing Alexander from a promise to explain, on the grounds that a promise extracted after a near-death and a beer is not fair to the person making it. Alexander has disclosed only that something happened to him and that he does not understand it either, which is the closest he has come to naming the System to anyone. The System itself remains unknown to Owen and to every other character (Profile Section 14.4).\n\nThe relationship's other quality is that it is the first thing in the campaign Alexander has not calculated. He gave away a healing potion, refused thanks in favor of getting drunk together, paid a whole tab, and took an unconscious man home rather than leaving him — none of it advancing any objective he holds."
state: "**First night together, 2026-07-29 into 2026-07-30, at Owen's Rogers Park apartment.** After the crew's Coalition meeting and a bonding dinner with the rest of the crew, Alexander deliberately gave Owen the evening alone — then texted him within the hour asking if he was still up. Owen: 'was hoping you'd cave first tbh.' Alexander went to him. Both spoke it plainly for the first time — Alexander: 'I want you. I want us.' Owen: 'You. Just you... I don't know what you are, and it doesn't change this.' The System remains unknown to Owen; he has stated outright that not knowing doesn't change what he wants. Morning found them still together, Owen asleep with an arm over Alexander. The relationship is no longer a question either is dancing around, though neither has used the word for it yet. Over dinner the evening before, Owen also disclosed that his mother was a hospice nurse and that mending felt like inherited work the first time he understood what he'd become."
history: "Formed over roughly twenty hours. Owen was assigned as Alexander's rear-position partner at staging on 2026-07-28 (`EVT-000070`) and spent the clear watching him do impossible things: intercepting a beast to protect him, taking a fatal hit and standing up unharmed, summoning a dagger from nothing twice, and producing a healing potion he had not been carrying. Alexander's first genuine warmth toward anyone in this campaign was directed at him mid-Gate (`EVT-000077`) — a joke about an owed beer, declining Owen's healing to bank it for worse need, an arm around his shoulder, and the first smile the crew had seen from him. Owen then cleared Alexander's Severe rib injury with a C-rank treatment touch (`EVT-000080`), the first exercise of the Profile 1.5 mender rule. The beer followed the clear, and the rest followed the beer (`EVT-000081`)."
texture: "**How these two actually are together — the register a Runtime should play, not just the fact of the relationship.**\n\nIt is *funny* before it is anything else. They tease constantly and neither wins. Alexander calls him 'mister no-sparks' and 'O great mage'; Owen is genuinely affronted by 'mage' ('there's no wand, there's no — *sparkles*'), insists 'mender' with the weary precision of a man who has lost this argument before, and takes it as a compliment anyway. Alexander charged him a fee to use his own shower. There was a pillow fight the morning after, which Owen lost catastrophically to a bedsheet while hungover, and about which he demanded the record show he was ambushed by a man who had killed a boss the previous day.\n\n**Owen's tell is his hands.** When he is composed he turns his glass a quarter-turn on the wood; when he isn't, he finds somewhere to put a hand — flat on Alexander's chest, curled into his shirt, absent-minded on the back of his head. His dryness is armor and it stops working around Alexander: he goes red from the collarbone up, his voice climbs, he starts a sentence and reroutes it, he laughs at things that aren't quite jokes. He is habitually the one who stays sober to drive everyone home and has almost no tolerance, and he is aware this makes him appalling at drinking.\n\n**Alexander is unguarded here and nowhere else.** He is cold or merely correct with Priya, Julian, and Renata — he overruled Julian flatly over the boss drop within the same hour he was warm with Owen. The smile he can't control is Owen's alone; the crew has seen him smile exactly once, and it was aimed at Owen. He initiates the physical contact every time (an arm around the shoulder, a hand taken in both of his, a kiss on the cheek, blocking the doorway to tease), and Owen's reaction is consistently *startled, then delighted* — he does not expect to be someone's person and says so: 'People are grateful to me... I get thanked a lot and it isn't the same thing at all.'\n\n**The unspoken thing is handled with deliberate care on both sides.** Alexander began a sentence — 'I...' — and stopped; Owen heard it, went still for half a second, and said only 'Mm,' meaning *I know, whenever, I'm not going anywhere*. He keeps that promise even when it visibly costs him. Warmth is the medium through which the secret is *not* discussed, not the lever used to extract it.\n\n**Owen looks after him in small practical ways** that are not mender's work: telling him to eat, noting he's had eggs and beer since yesterday, releasing him from promises made while exhausted, and pointing out that Alexander is carrying six things at once. Alexander's reciprocal gesture is to give things away without accounting for them — the potion, the tab, his bed."
