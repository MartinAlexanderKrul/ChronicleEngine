# World Ledger - Gatefall: Pendragon

**Campaign:** Gatefall: Pendragon - **World:** Gatefall (`worlds/gatefall/`)
**Ledger:** Canonical Record (`011` Section 8) holding the protagonist's Knowledge States and the campaign's view of world state.

This ledger records what is visible and accessible to the campaign. It references authoritative Gatefall records; it does not duplicate objective world canon. Objective reality is owned by the world-layer records cited below and is never restated here as a campaign fact.

qualities: "Unaffiliated freelance hunter registered with the Windy City Hunters Coalition's freelancer desk — not a guild employee, not under contract to any crew. The Coalition is the default hook for an unaffiliated Chicago hunter (Profile Campaign Creation; `worlds/gatefall/institutions/windy-city-coalition/250_INSTITUTION_LEDGER.md`)."
state: "Active freelance registration, about one week old, coincident with his hunter license. No crew has taken him onto a posted contract yet."

## Protagonist-Accessible World Facts

References into authoritative Gatefall records. These are pointers, not copies; the cited record remains the sole owner of each fact.

| Fact visible to Alexander | Authoritative record | Access |
|---|---|---|
| Chicago and the Lakefront/Red Line Gate corridors | `ENT-000087`, `ENT-000090` (`worlds/gatefall/210_PLACES.md`) | Present; direct |
| BGM Region V — federal regulator, licensing and grading, contract auctions | `ENT-000099` (`worlds/gatefall/institutions/bgm-region-v/`) | Public; his own licensing authority |
| The Windy City Hunters Coalition — freelancer co-op | `ENT-000102`, `REL-000062` | Member; direct |
| Horizon Guild and Ironline Guild exist and do not want him | `ENT-000100`, `ENT-000101` | Public; common trade knowledge |
| Gate grading (E-S), posting floors, and the five-hunter posting floor on E/D contracts | Profile Section 9.2, 9.4 | Common licensed-hunter knowledge |
| A Red Line Corridor contract is posted, assessed unconfirmed D, detected 2026-07-18 | `EVT-000051` (`worlds/gatefall/260_SEED_EVENTS.md`) | Public board listing — visible to any hunter who checks the boards, undersubscribed at Red Line rates |
| The System does not publicly exist; no one on Earth believes in it | `worlds/gatefall/200_WORLD_BIBLE.md` | Common knowledge (universal — there is nothing to know yet) |

Not visible to Alexander at start: BGM Region V's internal Grading Bench field notes flagging the Red Line Gate's mana-pressure curve as climbing faster than a true D (`EVT-000051`'s non-public detail), and the identities or agendas of any of Gatefall's notable figures beyond ordinary public reputation.

**Update, 2026-07-24 (`EVT-000059`):** The System attached to Alexander mid-clear, inside the Red Line Corridor Gate — see `100_CHARACTER_SHEET.md`'s `system_state`. This changes nothing about what is *publicly* known (the row below still holds: the System does not publicly exist, and nothing about Earth's or Gatefall's common knowledge has changed), but it is no longer true that Alexander has nothing System-side to know — he is now the world's first and only Bearer, a fact perceptible to him alone (Profile Section 14.4) and unknown to his crew, the Coalition, or anyone else.

## Common Knowledge (Section 20.1 — established, not restated per scene)

Alexander holds the common knowledge of a licensed hunter one week into his career: Gates open continuously across the metro (~35/week in Chicago), most are E or D grade, an assessed grade carries a stated confidence (confirmed vs. unconfirmed), a Gate left past its break timer breaks and its remaining population pours out, and death in a Gate is final — there is no rescue clause the trade believes in. None of this is a secret; it is what BGM intake and a week of hearing other hunters talk have already taught him.
