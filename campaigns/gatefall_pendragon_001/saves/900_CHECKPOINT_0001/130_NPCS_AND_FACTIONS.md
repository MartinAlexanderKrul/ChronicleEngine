## Campaign-Local Figures — Session 1

### ENT-000126 — Tanya Voss

Crew lead and striker; mid-30s, an experienced Gate clearer with three-plus clears behind her alongside Marcus. She recruited Alexander onto the Red Line Corridor contract after reading him as someone who would commit rather than fold — reputation is "what the desk thinks," she told him, and "fact is what happens in a Gate."

relationships:
  - REL-000063
canonical_state:
  location: ENT-000087
  condition: "Healthy; equipped with a heavier reinforced jacket and shoulder plating than an E-rank starter kit"
  capabilities: "Experienced licensed hunter and crew leader; striker working type; three-plus prior Gate clears with Marcus. Reads people quickly and decisively."
  personality: "Direct, competent, unsentimental. Judges hunters by conduct in a Gate, not by desk reputation. Takes calculated risks on people who show commitment; does not waste time on those she expects to fold."
  situation: "Leading the five-hunter Red Line Corridor clear (unconfirmed D, timer breaking midnight 2026-07-24). Recruited Alexander to fill an open slot after he committed at the Coalition case table, signed the crew contract, and briefed him with Marcus. As of 8:00 AM 2026-07-24 she has the crew assembled at the Gate entrance."
```

### ENT-000127 — Marcus

The crew's sensor: an awakened whose gift reads Gate interiors — layout, population density, and whether a dungeon is holding something its assessment missed. Quiet and analytical; he is Tanya Voss's established partner and reads the space on entry so the crew knows what it is actually walking into.

  personality: "Quiet, focused, observes before acting. Takes the measure of new people carefully."
  situation: "Assigned to point for the Red Line Corridor clear, reading the interior on entry. Present at the 2026-07-23 briefing and at the Gate entrance on 2026-07-24. Surname unestablished."
```

### ENT-000128 — Elias Voss

Striker and Tanya's brother; broad-shouldered, blunt-force fighter carrying a reinforced steel hammer, two-plus years licensed. He greeted Alexander warmly and told him plainly that if they were in the Gate together, he had his back.

```

### ENT-000129 — Dr. Sarah Chen

The crew's mender — the rare awakened who heals by touch, closing wounds mid-fight (roughly one awakened in twelve). Six months licensed; Horizon Guild tried to poach her twice and she stayed independent. Petite, athletic, medical kit across her chest; calm and crisis-trained. She told Alexander plainly: stay alive, and let her keep him that way.

  personality: "Calm, focused, prioritizes keeping people alive. Direct about her role and what she expects of the crew."
  situation: "Mender for the Red Line Corridor clear, kept mobile and in reserve during the clear. Introduced herself to Alexander at the Gate entrance on 2026-07-24 and told him to come to her if hurt."
```

### ENT-000130 — Kesha Morrison

Senior coordinator at the Windy City Hunters Coalition desk; about fifty, solid build, a memory for faces and files that makes her good at the job. She had spent days looking at Alexander's file with visible doubt — but when he came back with a signed contract, she witnessed it, filed it with Region V, and allowed that he had made a good pull.

  capabilities: "Senior freelancer coordinator at the Windy City Hunters Coalition; manages postings, crew assignments, and contract witnessing/filing with BGM Region V. Strong memory for hunters' files and faces. Not established as a combat-active hunter."
  personality: "Direct and professional. Reads a file and communicates doubt without cruelty; respects hunters who follow through on a commitment."
  situation: "Alexander's principal Coalition desk contact. On 2026-07-23 she pointed him toward Tanya Voss's undersubscribed Red Line crew, witnessed and filed his signed contract, and gave him a list of three E-grade gear vendors."
```

### ENT-000131 — Diane

Owner and operator of **Ironbound**, the independent gear shop on Milwaukee Avenue; mid-40s, built solid, moving with the bearing of someone who has spent time in Gates. She fitted Alexander for his first kit, steered him toward mobility over heavy plate given his krav maga background, and told him to come back after his first clear to talk over what worked. (Ironbound the establishment is represented at this stage by its owner Diane; it carries no separate institution entity.)

  situation: "Sold Alexander his first hunter-grade kit on 2026-07-23 (reinforced leather jacket $800, E-grade dagger $500, reinforced gauntlets $600, shin guards $100; $2,000 total), custom-fitted the gauntlets, and invited him back after his first clear. Represents the Ironbound establishment, which has no separate entity."
```

### ENT-000132 — Cutting Edge

A custom E-/D-grade gear shop in Chicago's warehouse district, one of three vendors Kesha Morrison named to Alexander. Known for good-quality custom work on a slower turnaround. Alexander did not visit it.

```

### ENT-000133 — Horizon's Outfitter

Horizon Guild's affiliated gear outfitter on Michigan Avenue, the third vendor on Kesha Morrison's list: pricier than the independents, but reliable stock and service with no custom-fitting delay. Alexander chose Ironbound over it for value and did not visit.

## Campaign Relationships

### REL-000062 — Windy City Hunters Coalition (institutional affiliation)

Defined in `110_WORLD_LEDGER.md` (`REC-000075`). Alexander's freelancer registration with the Coalition; as of 2026-07-23 it is the channel through which he was placed on Tanya Voss's crew.

### REL-000063 — Alexander's membership in Tanya Voss's crew

```yaml
id: REL-000063
canonical_record: REC-000077
schema_version: "0.1.2"
status: active
provenance:
  source: EVT-000058
  event_time: "2026-07-23, contract signed"
  record_time: "2026-07-24T09:00:00Z"
endpoints:
  - ENT-000125
  - ENT-000126
type: crew-membership
qualities: "Alexander's place in Tanya Voss's five-hunter Red Line Corridor crew, anchored to the crew lead (Voss). Full roster: Tanya Voss (ENT-000126, lead/striker), Marcus (ENT-000127, sensor), Elias Voss (ENT-000128, striker), Dr. Sarah Chen (ENT-000129, mender), and Alexander Pendragon (ENT-000125, striker/martial artist). Contract: the posted Red Line Corridor clear (EVT-000051), unconfirmed D, timer breaking midnight 2026-07-24. Split: the Gatefall standard party split (Profile Section 13) — the crew leader takes a 10% leader's share off the top, and the remaining 90% is divided equally among all five members, leader included. Tanya's desk shorthand of a 'five-way split' referred to that equal division of the remainder; no flat-equal deviation was negotiated, so standard terms govern."
state: "Active. Contract signed 2026-07-23 and filed with BGM Region V by Kesha Morrison; crew briefed the same evening and assembled at the Gate entrance 08:00 on 2026-07-24. Alexander's first formal crew affiliation; Tanya assessed him as 'solid' after he committed. No loot has yet been earned or split."
history: "Formed at the Coalition case table on 2026-07-23 when Alexander, directed by Kesha Morrison, committed to Voss's undersubscribed crew and signed the standard five-hunter contract (EVT-000058)."
